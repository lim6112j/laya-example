// A/B harness for the Breakout reachability ontology.
//
//   uv run uvicorn server:app        # terminal 1
//   node eval_breakout.mjs --n 150 --seed 7
//
// THE ONES YOU ASKED FOR: `ontology-off` is the demo exactly as it was before the
// ontology existed — every ball gets asked about. `ontology-on` is the same game with the
// gate closed, so a ball the reasoner calls unreachable is never put to the model.
//
// THE MEASUREMENT IS NOT SCORE, AND THE HARNESS SAYS SO. It is tempting to report "score
// with the ontology on" and call the difference an improvement. It is not one: a suppressed
// question cannot be answered wrongly, but it also cannot be answered right, and the ball is
// lost either way. So this harness reports what actually changes —
//
//   questions asked        how much model attention the ontology removes
//   balls lost             should be ~unchanged; a large move means the gate ate a live ball
//   lost after an ask      the model's real failure rate, per arm
//   provably lost          balls no command could reach — these are physics, not model error
//
// and it reports the loss-classification split BECAUSE THAT is the honest presentation of
// "the demo stops blaming the model for physics-impossible catches".
//
// Imports the same static/breakout_sim.js the browser does, so there is no second
// implementation of the physics to drift out of sync — the same reason eval_rules.mjs works
// this way. That is also why extracting the sim out of breakout.html was worth doing first.
//
// SCENARIOS ARE COUNTERFACTUAL. One policy drives each game forward and every decision tick
// is snapshotted. Both arms then answer the SAME snapshots, differing only in whether the
// gate let the question through. Otherwise arm A's paddle positions would steer arm B's
// future inputs and the comparison would measure nothing.

 * Drive a game forward with a fixed policy and snapshot every decision tick.
 *
 * THE POLICY IS *LAGGING* AIM, NOT PERFECT PLAY, and that took one wrong version to learn.
 * Generating scenarios with a perfect paddle puts the ball exactly where it needs to be, so
 * every snapshot comes out 100% reachable: the gate suppresses nothing, the closed form
 * never disagrees, and the harness prints a clean sheet of zeros having measured nothing.
 * That is exactly what the first version of this function did. It looked like a strong
 * result and was entirely vacuous.
 *
 * A real model answers on a ~250ms cadence and its answer is imperfect, so the paddle spends
 * much of each descent out of position. Re-aiming only at each tick reproduces that: the
 * paddle commits to one command between asks, and is often wrong. Scenarios generated that
 * way contain both catchable and hopeless balls, which is the only way the gate has anything
 * to suppress.
 *
 * The bias is a FIXED per-seed offset in px rather than per-step noise, so a scenario
 * replays identically across runs and across arms — the reason the RNG is seeded at all.
