// WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE. breakout.html used to hold its physics inline, which
// meant the only way to check any claim about it was to load a browser and count bricks
// on screen. fleet_sim.js was split out for exactly this reason, and the comment there
// says it: the browser and the A/B harness must not be able to drift apart. This file is
// the half that can be tested; breakout.html is only the DOM layer over it.
//
// NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE DOM. No document, no window, no canvas. `step()` returns
// events and lets the caller update whatever it likes — the HUD in the browser, nothing
// at all in the node harness. This is what makes the reachability rollout below
// trustworthy: it runs the same code the game runs.

// drifting sideways while it falls, it reflects off the side walls, and a catch happens if
// the ball is in reach at ANY moment in the contact band rather than only at one instant.
//
// Worse, the residual error runs in one direction. The closed forms declared thousands of
// balls uncatchable that the physics actually catches — which is precisely the failure
// this whole feature exists to fix, since it would exculpate the model on balls it lost.
//
// Cost, measured: ~9us for a typical ball, ~95us in the worst case (a ball descending at
// ~50px/s, which is the longest horizon — see `rolloutHorizon`). Decision ticks are 150-500ms
// apart, so even the worst case is ~0.06% of the gap between asks. There is no honest

 * What a reflection actually invalidates is the SIDE of the paddle the ball will arrive on.
 * That is what the paddle is driving toward and what the model's answer named, and a
